# Stock-Analysis
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to make future investment decisions based on stock performance from previous years. This can be done by calculating past yearly returns from multiple stocks.

### Results
According to the stock data that was available to us, stock performance as a whole was much better in 2017 than 2018.  Almost all stocks generated a positive return in 2017 while the results were mixed for 2018. A couple of stocks made a profit of more than 80% while some others decreased in value by as much as 62%. The time it took to run the analysis was fairly quick. The execution time for the refactored code was instantaneous (0.1015625 seconds for 2017 and 0.109375 seconds for 2018) while the original script took a little longer to run.

### Summary
Benefits of refactoring code include improving the code's internal structure, quality and readability without making changes to its external behavior.  Redundant and repetitive code can be replaced and the code can run more efficiently.  However, you won't be able to add new functionality into an application by just refactoring code.  It might also be very time consuming if new bugs are introduced during the refactoring process.  
Refactoring worked well in this VBA script since the objective and type of information we wanted to analyze was the same.  Making adjustments to the existing code resulted in a faster execution time and improved code readability.
